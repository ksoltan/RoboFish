## Bio-Inspired Feedback Research

Our fish can flap! To accurately create the complicated gaits we want, though, the fish needs to know where it's joints actually are. The solution is some kind of feedback.

This branch serves two purposes:

- Gathering research about feedback
- Documenting our experiments

At the moment, I see this project as consisting of three tasks:

- Deciding what sensors would be appropriate for our fish
- Physically integrating those sensors into our fish
- Integrating their output into the motion control

I'm not exactly sure on the format yet, but I'll update this README as I get situated.
