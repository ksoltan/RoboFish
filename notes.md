- Added full_fish_pwm_control to hinge_control branch; it's the fleshed out class-based fish. 

- Fixed up simple_flap a bit so it's simpler and does what we want.

- Tested the three joints with new simple_flap; the tail joint works, the thorax and head joints click but do not move. I'll investigate this some more.
