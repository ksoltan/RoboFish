- This paper is a review of applications of control theory to understanding the nervous system. 
- Our brain receives input from sense organs, causes the body to move in response, then receives new input from the sense organs. It's a closed feedback loop, which explains how we're able to keep our bodies upright.
- This is exactly what we want the fish to do. I'll return to this paper once I've spent more time picking sensors.
