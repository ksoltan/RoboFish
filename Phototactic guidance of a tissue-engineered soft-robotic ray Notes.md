- This project seems to be primarily material-driven. The only "intelligence" the ray has is encoded in its physical shape. It would be impossible to create complex, adaptive behaviors with this model.
- It requires outside control in the form of light directed at the front of the ray.
- Could we adapt the actuation, which is currently externally controlled, to be controlled by some sort of internal process?
- Feedback in this system is fairly natural, like a line-following robot; if it strays too far one direction, its own mechanism of motion will automatically correct. There's no central processing. It's elegant.
-  It's interesting that the robot is actually made out of biological tissues, and controlled by light-activated protein circuits; quite different from our wire, magnet, and plastic-based approach. I'm curious how the power outputs compare. I imagine that beyond the gold-plated skeleton, this robot is actually pretty biodegradable, which is one of our goals.
